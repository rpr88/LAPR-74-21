It is being seen as an indication of new and less repressive policies to be introduced when General Ernesto Geisel takes over the presidency next year. But other observers are less optimistic. They point out that both these cases relate only to common criminals and that this cannot be taken as an indication of any easing of repressive measures against political prisoners. This analysis is from the London Weekly Latin America.",
